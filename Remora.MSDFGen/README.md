Remora.MSDFGen
==============

Remora.MSDFGen is a C# implementation of Viktor Chlumsky's multi-channel signed
distance field generator library, based on code from Ryan Vazquez's C# port.

Chlumsky's implementation can be found [here][1].

Vazquez's implementation can be found [here][2].

The reason for this library is to have a freestanding implementation without
any other dependencies, as Vazquez's work is tied to a broader game engine.
